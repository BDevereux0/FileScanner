Explanation:
    This class drives the menu and makes calls to the service class to search: Java readable docs(i.e .txt), PDF docs
    and in the future word docs (using Apache PIO library.) The PDF docs are read using PDFBox, also from Apache. These
    libraries are used because they are apart of the Apache foundation and I assume free from malware.

    The executeMenuOrder method drives this class, all other methods feed it data. The methods are named based on there
    behavior. They are: getFilePathAndSearchWord(), searchAgain(), determineFileType()

Fields
    Scanner - self explanatory. Closed in method searchAgain() if user selects 0.

Methods
    void executeMenuOrder() - drives the menu class.
            local variables
                String[] filePathAndKeyword - used to retrieve file path and keyword from getFilePathAndSearchWord()
                    0 - filePath
                    1 - keywordSearch
                int fileType - used to select which style of document will be processed. Conditional logic.
                SearchService object - used to process the documents. See SearchService documentation
            Dependencies
                SearchService
                Menu.getFilePathAndSearchWord() //not static
                service.processPDF
                service.processJavaDoc
                //to be implemented service.processWordDoc
                searchAgain()

    String getFilePathAndSearchWord() - requests user input, stores that input in an array and returns it to executeMenuOrder()
        local variables
            String[] ar - used to store user input values and returned to executeMenuOrder()

    void searchAgain() - requests user input, redirects to determineFileType or closes scanner & program based on user input
        local variables
            int searchAction - used to store user response and feeds conditional logic

    int determineFileType() - requests user input and returns it to executeMenuOrder
