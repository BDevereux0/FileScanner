Explanation
    The JavaDocReader object class is used a useCase for the service class. It uses a StringBuffer fed from an FileReader
        to produce an output that is then checked against a keyword. setReader() updates the file field and creates the reader.
        The setOutputText() uses the reader and a StringBuilder object to store the data in memory.
Fields
    BufferedReader - IO object
    StringBuilder - Used by the IO object to construct the output text.
    File - Used to return a value to the console. This value is ultimately the point of this program.

Methods
    void setReader(File file) - sets the file field and instantiates the BufferedReader. This is used by the ServiceClass.

        Local variables
            None

    void setOutputText() - used to set the outputText. A StringBuilder obj is fed via the BufferedReader.
        //I pretty much copied this method from Baeldung

    Local variables
        String line - the system checks this variable and if not null, populates the variable and then appends it to outputText

    Dependencies
        System.lineSeperator() - Returns the system-dependent line separator string.
