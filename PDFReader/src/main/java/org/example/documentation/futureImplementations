Figure out how to run this in the command line
    Having a problem with the command line program .jsp file. The text version works but
    but the PDFReader crashes. Possible fix: Move PDFStripper instantiation to the constructor
    for PDFReader.

Figure out how to write a script
    Write a script to run my program.

Recursive search of folders/files to search (currently hard coding the file path)
    Prob should do smth like:
        1. If path == file
            1a. run search
        2. If directory
            2a. recursively go through files/directory

Concurrency
    I want to use Threads to check multiple files at the same time or maybe just
    populate an array with file names for the the main thread to run the search.
    Either way... :/


What I need to do:
    Fix output of PDF reader
    Implement JavaDoc and MS Word reader
    Bugs:
        PDF path doesn't recognize improper values for path
        JavaDoc reader doesnt' work properly.

        When taking user input for type of file (determineFileType), if any non-numerical
        value is entered - app crashes.
